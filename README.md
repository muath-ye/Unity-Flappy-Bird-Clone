# Re:Coded - Flappy Bird clone using Unity

This is the unity project used to demonstrate flappy birds game made with Unity in the Intro to Game Development workshop that was held on Aug, 15th, 2022. 

P.S: If you hit play and it shows nothing but an empty screen, make sure that you navigate to the scenes folder in the projects tab.
